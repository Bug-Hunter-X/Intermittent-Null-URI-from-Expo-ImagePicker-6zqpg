# Expo ImagePicker - Intermittent Null URI Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  The issue is characterized by the intermittent return of a null or undefined URI after selecting an image from the device's gallery. This leads to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on the selected image URI.

## Bug Description
The `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync` function, when called, sometimes returns a result object where the `uri` property is null or undefined. This happens inconsistently, making it difficult to pinpoint the cause. The application might crash or display incorrect behavior if it attempts to use the null URI.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app on a physical device or emulator.
4. Open the image picker and select an image.  The issue does not occur on every image selection.

## Solution
The solution is to add error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where the `uri` property is null or undefined.  This prevents the application from crashing and allows for a more robust user experience.
